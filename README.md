native controls cordova plugin
-----------------------

(almost) compatible with phonegap 3.0

originally ported from:
https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/iOS/NativeControls

and 

https://github.com/zSprawl/NativeControls


currently tested only toolbar and actionsheet.

probably, this navbar is better than navbar from zsprawl:

https://github.com/sauliuz/phonegapplugs-navbar

native header and footer for android:

https://github.com/nax83/NativeGap

probably good start to develop nativecontrols for wp7/8
